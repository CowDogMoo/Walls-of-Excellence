## Destroy and Rebuild the Cluster

If the cluster becomes FUBAR, nuke it and rebuild:

```bash
# Destroy the cluster
mage runreset all

# Rebuild the cluster
mage runansible all
```

Then follow [these instructions](../kubernetes/bootstrap/README.md) to continue.

## Debugging

The official flux cheatsheet is chalk full of useful commands and tips for
debugging: <https://fluxcd.io/flux/cheatsheets/troubleshooting/>

### Bootstrapping the Cluster

If you are having trouble bootstrapping the cluster, try running the following
from the root of the repository:

```bash
export PATH_TO_FLUX_DEPLOYMENT=./kubernetes/flux-system/config
export REPO_OWNER=CowDogMoo
export REPO_NAME=Walls-of-Excellence

flux bootstrap github \
  --owner=$REPO_OWNER \
  --repository=$REPO_NAME \
  --path=$PATH_TO_FLUX_DEPLOYMENT \
  --personal \
  --token-auth
```

Once that has finished, remove the redundant `flux-system` directory
generated by the `flux bootstrap` command:

```bash
rm -rf kubernetes/flux-system/config/flux-system/
```

Finish with:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Remove redundant flux-system directory"
git push
```
